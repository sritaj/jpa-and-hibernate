## Instructions

### Running SpringBoot Application and Tests in Local System

1. There are two Spring Boot Application file (annotated by SpringBootApplication), **JDBCApplication** and **
   JpaAndHibernateApplication**; by default JpaAndHibernateApplication is configured for the Run, JDBCApplication
   annotation is commented out.
2. To run the JDBCApplication to check SpringJDBC specific Runs, uncomment the SpringBootApplication annotation in the
   file and comment the SpringBootApplication annotation in the JpaAndHibernateApplication file
3. The properties file have configuration for H2 database and MySQL, by default H2 database is setup

### Running SpringBoot Application and Tests in Local System in H2 database

1. To run the tests in H2 database, uncomment the configuration for H2 in application.properties and comment out the
   MySQL database, MongoDB properties
2. On running the Tests file or the JPAandHibernateApplication file the H2 database will be utitlized and the data can
   be cross-checked in the H2 database
3. The data.sql will be loaded to the H2 database for Test data when the H2 database is configured

### Running SpringBoot Application and Tests in Local System in MySQL Database

1. To run the tests in MySQL database, uncomment the configuration for MySQL in application.properties and comment out
   the H2 database, MongoDB properties
2. Configure the MySQL database in the local environment
3. From the src/main/resources take the **db_schema.sql** first and then the **table.sql** and run the script in MySQL
   to create the DB, Users and Relevant Tables required
4. On running the Tests file or the JPAandHibernateApplication file the MySQL database will be utitlized and the data
   can be cross-checked in the MySQL database

### Running SpringBoot Application and Tests in Local System in MongoDB

1. To run the tests in MongoDB, uncomment the configuration for MongoDB in application.properties and comment out the H2
   and MySQL database properties
2. On running the Tests file ***ItemSpringDataMongoRepositoryTest*** located under test/*/repository/mongodb/ the
   MongoDB will be utilized and the data can be cross-checked in the MongoDB

## Setup/TroubleShooting

1. Check the specified Port Number in application.properties is free or not, or else change it to an available port like
   9891, 9020
2. Setup the MySQL and MongoDB in local environment
